👋 Hi, I’m @Atlas-Tenebris

I'm an Information Systems student, currently in my third period. I've worked on backend projects involving authentication systems, CRUD operations, and databases with SQLite3 (Python library). I want to create more projects and continue evolving as a developer.

👀 I’m interested in...

Developing backend, frontend, and full-stack projects; focusing mainly on using Python for backend applications, and JavaScript for web development. The frameworks I want to learn are Django and Pandas for Python, and React for JavaScript.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Introductory and intermediate JavaScript, intermeditate SQL with PostgreSQL, Introductory JAVA and Introductory GO (Golang)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Backend projects (though I am open to frontend projects, my main focus is backend).

📫 How to reach me ...

⚡ Fun fact: ...

I discovered programming in high school when I created a program for complex mathematical calculations. 
As a result, I didn't learn the formulas and scored 4/10 on the test.
